# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.

It is a simple HTML project where I will create a basic website containing recipes using only HTML. The purpose is to practice:

- Structuring HTML documents
- Using proper tags (like links, images, lists)
- Linking multiple HTML pages together

By the end of this project, I will have reinforced my understanding of HTML fundamentals.
